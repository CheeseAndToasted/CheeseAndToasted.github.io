# CheeseAndToasted.github.io


Weather machine app built from scratch using Bootstrap, JQuery, OpenWeather's API and another API to get location information using IP address.  

Inspired by the FreeCodeCamp front end development challenge.  

All code is in a single file for ease of development.  For other projects this would not be the norm.
